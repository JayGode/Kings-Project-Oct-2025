Here is my take on the Kings September 2025 Data Science Project. Included here are all the original files of the project, as well as two .ipynb files.

.ipynb file 1: contains all code for my data cleaning and preparation, as well as my data analysis (including some trial and error), shows my full process with the data.

.ipynb file 2: contains only the cross-referencing of my data table full of individuals I found intriguing based from the analysis with the player name database so I could get full names of the player identities I found

In addition to this I will have sent a slideshow containing a more in-depth explanation/breakdown of my methodology. If you did not receive such a slideshow, contact me at jaredwgode@outlook.com and I will be happy to provide it.
